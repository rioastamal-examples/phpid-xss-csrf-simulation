## About

This is sample projects from my talk at PHPID-Online Learning with topic "Understanding XSS and CSRF Attack Through Simulation". There are two projects on this repository, first is `simulation-01/` for XSS demo and the second one is `simulation-02/` for CSRF demo. You can refer to each README.md of each directory for details how to run each simulation project.
